Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) negatively affects millions worldwide by damaging relationships, decreasing productivity, degrading physical well-being, and increasing the risk of suicide by 60%, creating the need for a robust, non-invasive depression detection method. DepressionDetector provides a solution by using a Convolutional Neural Network Model (CNN) to train, validate, and test audio samples from the SAD dataset. It uses several data transformations, included STFT and a Mel-Filterbank, and ImgAug, a data augmentation algorithm, to outperform several baseline models, achieving an accuracy of 92.31% on the SAD dataset. This model aims to assist psychiatrists, psychologists, and the average civilian in depression detection.
